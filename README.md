# monitoring and control system
I have built a web application that allows users to control home appliances such as lights. When two or more users control the appliances at the same the device state gets updated in each tab they open and also users can control lights by giving voice commands to the google assistant.

To receive sensor information(Motion detection, Gas detection, Fire Detection) I have used AJAX so that there is no need to hard refresh the entire page to get new data and also it sends alerts to the user if the threshold value is reached.

The device is in Off state but sure you can check out the cross-window communication of the control system.

Here is the working of my project:
